# QUESTION: What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful? 

### Definition: 
TypeScript can guess the type of a variable, even if we donâ€™t write the type ourselves.

For example:
Innstead of writing: let name: string = "Alice" We can just write let name = "Alice" because TypeScript will automatically understand that name is a string. This is called type inference.

### Why is Type Inference Helpful?
Type inference helps us in many simple but powerful ways:

1. We donâ€™t have to write the type every time. It saves time and keeps the code short.
2. The code looks neat and easy to read.
3. Even if we donâ€™t write the type, TypeScript still checks for errors.
4. You donâ€™t need to know all the types right away. TypeScript helps you while you learn.

### Real Example
Letâ€™s say 

let age = 25;
let user = "Tom";
let isStudent = true;
In this code:

TypeScript sees 25 and sets age as a number

It sees "Tom" and sets user as a string

It sees true and sets isStudent as a boolean

We did not write any types â€” but TypeScript understood everything correctly.

Now, if we try to do this:
age = "twenty-five"; 
TypeScript will give an error, because "twenty-five" is a string, not a number.

Even though we didnâ€™t write age: number, TypeScript already knows the type is number.
Thatâ€™s the power of type inference!

### Use Case in Real Projects
In small or big projects, we often declare variables and give values immediately.
For example:
const products = ["Pen", "Book", "Phone"];
TypeScript will automatically understand that this is an array of strings.

We donâ€™t need to write:
const products: string[] = ["Pen", "Book", "Phone"];
This makes the code easier to write and read.

#Final Thoughts
Type inference is a helpful tool in TypeScript.

It makes coding faster and easier.

It helps catch mistakes.

Itâ€™s perfect for beginners who donâ€™t want to write types everywhere.

It keeps our code clean, short, and safe.

You donâ€™t need to tell TypeScript everything â€” it already understands a lot!

<h1>Question: What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?</h1>

<h2> What are Interfaces and Types?</h2>
<p>
  In TypeScript, both <code>interface</code> and <code>type</code> are used to describe the shape of data (like objects). But there are some small differences between them.
</p>

<h2> 1. Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Both can define an object:</p>

<h3>Using <code>interface</code>:</h3>
<pre><code>interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Using <code>type</code>:</h3>
<pre><code>type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Both are valid and do the same thing here.</p>

<h2> 2. Extending</h2>

<p><strong>Interfaces</strong> can be extended using <code>extends</code>:</p>
<pre><code>interface Student extends Person {
  grade: number;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Types</strong> can also extend using <code>&</code> (intersection):</p>
<pre><code>type Student = Person & {
  grade: number;
};
</code></pre>

<h2> 3. Merging</h2>
<p><code>interface</code> can be declared more than once, and TypeScript merges them:</p>
<pre><code>interface Book {
  title: string;
}

interface Book {
  author: string;
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>type</code> cannot be re-declared. It will throw an error.</p>

<h2> 4. More Than Just Objects</h2>
<p><code>type</code> is more flexible. You can use it for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unions: <code>type ID = string | number;</code></li>
  <li>Tuples: <code>type Point = [number, number];</code></li>
  <li>Functions: <code>type Callback = () => void;</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸ§  Summary Table</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Feature</th>
    <th><code>interface</code></th>
    <th><code>type</code></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Define object shape</td>
    <td> Yes</td>
    <td> Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Extendable</td>
    <td> With <code>extends</code></td>
    <td> With <code>&</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can be merged</td>
    <td> Yes</td>
    <td> No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Supports primitives, unions, tuples</td>
    <td> No</td>
    <td> Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Best for classes</td>
    <td> Yes</td>
    <td> Sometimes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
  Use <code>interface</code> when you're working with objects or classes.<br/>
  Use <code>type</code> when you need to combine types, define functions, or handle unions.<br/>
  Both are powerful, and sometimes you can even use them together!
